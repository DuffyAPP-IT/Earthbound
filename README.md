# Earthbound

Earthbound is an WIP project based on Python, and is an automation based penetration testing toolkit, designed to be used alongside other applications that should already be installed on your machine.

This includes nmap, metagoofil etc. Kali should have all the preinstalled applications necessary for Earthbound to function.

If you prefer to use another distribution, I will list app the dpeendencies when the program is launched.
