# Earthbound

Earthbound is an WIP project based on Python, and is an automation based penetration testing toolkit, designed to be used alongside other applications that should already be installed on your machine.

Kali should have all the preinstalled applications necessary for Earthbound to function although I will provide an extended list of dependencies soon.
